# Asdl Project Jurek Sander
Project for the lecture Analyzing Software using Deep Learning.

## Creating the random bug dataset
The folder https://github.com/sanderjk5/asdl-project-sander/tree/main/dockerfiles contains the fixed dockerfile which allows to create the random bug dataset of Buglab without Nvidia Cuda. The new rewriting scout in https://github.com/sanderjk5/asdl-project-sander/blob/main/rewriting/rewritescouts.py extends the bug patterns of Buglab.
